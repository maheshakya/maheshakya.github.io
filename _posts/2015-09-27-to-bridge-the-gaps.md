A background - Importance of tools for machine learning and scientific computing as a whole

How effectively can we bring purely mathematical and mere conceptual models/mechanisms into the utilization of common man? Is it plausible to make the prerequisite technical know-how for dealing with such models
indifferent among multiple ranges of intellectual levels? That said, are these mechanisms capable of functioning with a variety of applications and data. To which extent can these scale?
The advent of tools for emulating learning theory has trasnpired amidts these concerns. 

Frameworks which perform computational learning tasks had started to emerge approximately at the same time as the inception of Machine Learning as a another branch of Artificial Intelligence. At early stages,
these frameworks basically emulated the exact algorithms with small samples of data and almost all of them were CLI based frameworks (Command Line Interface). Majority of them were used only in laborotaries in
very specific application. But our society has evolved much and progressed through a myriad of milestones along the path of artificial intelligence and nowadays almost all the organizations require some amount of
data analytics and machine learning to keep abreast with the ever-growing technology. This trend has as become exigent due to the massive amounts of data being collected and stored each and every day. With this inclination,
the demand for the tools that conduct the entire range of workflows of data analytics as been elevated colossaly.

When creating tools, we mainly consider following aspects:

1. HCI - userbility
2. Scalability
3. Lisence - availability to users
4. Use cases and compatibility with others

UI for HCI

Guided process
Advanced visualizations - for analysing/ preprocessing/ feature engineering
Results interpretation - identify what's wrong? and where's wrong? predicted vs actual
And more?

distributed deployment - scalability
Spark

Open-source

Connectivity with other data analytics tools

What's next?
